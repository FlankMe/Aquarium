## Aquarium
Simple simulation of an aquarium with fish and predators

The agents follow very simple rules:
- the prey (black squares) moves on straight lines;
- greedy predators (red rectangles) chase the single closest prey;
- aware predators (blue rectangles) chase the mass of prey.


### Quick Start
Download `aquarium v3.0.py` and `menu.py` to the same folder. Then, launch `aquarium v3.0.py`.  
Alternatively, check out [this video simulation][1] on Youtube.  
This code was written as an exercise to familiarise with PyGame.  


### Requirements
* PyGame. I used version 1.9.2a0.  
You can download it from [here][2].
