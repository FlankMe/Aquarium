### Aquarium
Simple simulation of an aquarium with fish and predators

- The fish (black squares) move on a straight line;
- The dolphins (blue rectangles) chase the mass of fish;
- The sharks (red rectangles) chase the single closest fish.

See which species outlives the other

## Quick Start
This code was written as an exercise to familiarise myself with PyGame.  
You need to download the 2 files 'aquarium v3.0.py' and 'menu.py'

> **Requirements**:  
You need Pygame. I used version 1.9.2a0.
